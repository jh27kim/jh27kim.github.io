## About Me

I am a second-year Ph.D. student in the School of Computing at KAIST, where I am advised by [Prof. Minhyuk Sung](https://mhsung.github.io/).
I work on designing generative models and efficient inference algorithms for synthesizing diverse data, capturing the inherent structure, representations, and physical constraints of the underlying modality.
